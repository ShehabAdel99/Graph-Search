# Graph Search

The Graph Search project is a Python-based implementation of various search strategies applied to weighted graphs. This project includes modules to draw weighted graphs, designate a start node, and identify goal nodes. Additionally, it provides functionality to select and apply different AI search strategies on the given graph.


## Key Features

- Module to draw weighted graphs (directed or undirected).
- Selection and application of various AI search strategies, including:
   - Depth First Search
   - Breadth First Search
   - Uniform Cost Search
   - Iterative Deepening Search
   - Greedy Search
   - A* Search
- Implementation of both uniformed and informed search strategies.
- Python-based implementation for search methods.
- Compatibility with various GUI frameworks for user interaction.

## Project Structure


The project is structured into several modules, each serving a specific purpose:

1) Graph Drawing Module: This module provides functionality to draw weighted graphs, designate a start node, and identify goal nodes.

2) Search Strategy Module: Contains implementations of various search strategies, including depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, iterative deepening, greedy, and A* search.

3) GUI Wrapper: While the core functionality is implemented in Python, the project allows for integration with any GUI framework to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the graph and search algorithms.
